When I click on a link, the command line shows: 1) the IP address from where the request originated 
(in this case, 127.0.0.1), 2) the date and time stamp of the request, 3) implementation of the "GET" request 
for the specific address like "/ping.html", 4) the communication protocol used (in this case, "HTTP 1.1") and
finally at the end of the line 5) 200 code to indicate success in finding and retreiving the resource. 
This record represents the request/response action between the client(browser) when a user clicks on the link
and the HTTP server provides or serves each resource (page) as it is requested.
